Execution and how the Flask-Dash application works:
 File Execution:
    1-app.py //The main entry point of your Flask-Dash application.
    2-main_app/__init__.py //Entry point for your Flask application, where Flask server and Dash applications are configured.
    3-main_app/routes.py  //Loaded when __init__.py is executed.
    4-main_app/app_1/layout.py and main_app/app_2/layout.py //Loaded when __init__.py is executed.
    5-main_app/app_1/callback.py and main_app/app_2/callback.py //Loaded when __init__.py is executed.
    6-base.html ,dash.html,index.html //Loaded when routes are accessed and templates are rendered.
    7-data.py
    8-appstyle.css //Loaded when templates are rendered and styles are applied.
    9-config.py
 Application Workflow:
    1-Initialization(app.py,__init__.py,routes.py )
    2-Accessing Routes
    3-Rendering Templates (base.html, dash.html, index.html ,appstyle.css)
    4-Interactivity (callback.py ,data.py)
